**Difficulty:** 373

## Problem Statement

Chef decided to redecorate his house, and now needs to decide between two different styles of interior design.

For the first style, tiling the floor will cost $X_1$ rupees and painting the walls will cost $Y_1$ rupees.

For the second style, tiling the floor will cost $X_2$ rupees and painting the walls will cost $Y_2$ rupees.

Chef will choose whichever style has the lower total cost. How much will Chef pay for his interior design?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing $4$ space-separated integers $X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2$ as described in the statement.

### Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the amount Chef will pay for interior design.


### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2 \leq 100$

### Sample 1:
```
Input:
4
10 20 9 25
10 20 9 20
10 20 20 10
100 43 85 61

Output:
30
29
30
143
```
**Explanation:**
**Test case $1$:** The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $9 + 25 = 34$ rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay $30$ rupees.

**Test case $2$:** The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $9 + 20 = 29$ rupees. The second is cheaper, so Chef will pay $29$ rupees.

**Test case $3$:** The first style costs $10 + 20 = 30$ rupees, and the second costs $20 + 10 = 30$ rupees. Both styles cost the same, so Chef is always going to pay $30$ rupees.

**Test case $4$:** The first style costs $100 + 43 = 143$ rupees, and the second costs $85 + 61 = 146$ rupees. The first is cheaper, so Chef will pay $143$ rupees.
